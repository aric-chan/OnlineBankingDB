1. Projection query ($varProject is a variable selected in the drop down menu)

SELECT $varProject FROM Customer

3. Join query

SELECT Product.Product_ID, Product.Status, Product.Type, Product.Interest_Rate, Loan.Maturity, Loan.Amount FROM Product, Loan WHERE Product.Product_ID = Loan.Product_ID

SELECT Product.Product_ID, Product.Status, Product.Type, Product.Interest_Rate, Credit_Cards.CardLimit, Credit_Cards.Rebate_Rate FROM Product, Credit_Cards WHERE Product.Product_ID = Credit_Cards.Product_ID

4. Division query

SELECT Full_Name FROM Customer WHERE CID IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT CID FROM Account a1
        WHERE NOT EXISTS (
            (SELECT Account_Type FROM Account)
            EXCEPT
            (SELECT Account_Type FROM Account a2 WHERE a1.CID = a2.CID)))

5. Aggregation query

SELECT MAX(Balance) FROM Account

SELECT MIN(Balance)FROM Account

6. Nested aggregation with group-by

SELECT AVG(Balance),Account_Type FROM Account GROUP BY Account_Type

7. Delete operation

ALTER TABLE Account ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Account_Customer FOREIGN KEY (CID) REFERENCES Customer(CID) ON DELETE CASCADE

ALTER TABLE Deposit ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Account_Deposit FOREIGN KEY (Account_Number) REFERENCES Account(Account_Number) ON DELETE CASCADE

ALTER TABLE Withdraw ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Account_Withdraw FOREIGN KEY (Account_Number) REFERENCES Account(Account_Number) ON DELETE CASCADE

DELETE FROM CUSTOMER WHERE CID = $varCid

SELECT CID, FULL_NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE, Date_Of_Birth, Email FROM Customer

SELECT Account_Number, Balance, Account_Type, CID FROM Account

8. Update Operation

UPDATE Customer SET Address = '$varAddress' WHERE CID = $varCid

UPDATE Customer SET Address = '$varAddress', Phone = $varPhone WHERE CID = $varCid

UPDATE Customer SET Address = '$varAddress', Phone = $varPhone, Email = '$varEmail' WHERE CID = $varCid

UPDATE Customer SET Address = '$varAddress', Email = '$varEmail' WHERE CID = $varCid

UPDATE Customer SET Phone = $varPhone WHERE CID = $varCid

UPDATE Customer SET Phone = $varPhone, Email = '$varEmail' WHERE CID = $varCid

UPDATE Customer SET Email = '$varEmail' WHERE CID = $varCid

SELECT CID, FULL_NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE, Date_Of_Birth, Email FROM Customer c WHERE CID = $varCid
